First, the per-step progress inequality has an incorrect coefficient; the standard derivation yields 1/(2L), not L. Second, the proof incorrectly concludes convergence to a global minimum for non-convex functions.

By the descent lemma, for any x, y:\\nf(y) <= f(x) + <\\nabla f(x), y-x> + (L/2)||y-x||^2.\\n\\n1. Let x = x_k and y = x_{k+1}. The gradient descent update is x_{k+1} = x_k - \\eta \\nabla f(x_k), so y-x = -\\eta \\nabla f(x_k).\\n\\n2. Substituting into the lemma:\\nf(x_{k+1}) <= f(x_k) - \\eta ||\\nabla f(x_k)||^2 + (L\\eta^2/2)||\\nabla f(x_k)||^2\\nf(x_{k+1}) <= f(x_k) - (\\eta - L\\eta^2/2)||\\nabla f(x_k)||^2.\\n\\n3. Set the step size \\eta = 1/L. The coefficient becomes (1/L - L(1/L)^2/2) = 1/L - 1/(2L) = 1/(2L).\\n\\n4. Thus, we have the per-step progress guarantee:\\nf(x_{k+1}) <= f(x_k) - (1/(2L))||\\nabla f(x_k)||^2.\\n\\n5. This inequality implies f(x_{k+1}) <= f(x_k), so the function value is non-increasing. If f is bounded below by f_inf, we can sum the inequality from k=0 to N-1:\\n\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (1/(2L))||\\nabla f(x_k)||^2 <= \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (f(x_k) - f(x_{k+1})) = f(x_0) - f(x_N) <= f(x_0) - f_inf.\\n\\n6. As N -> \\infty, the sum on the left is bounded, which implies that the term ||\\nabla f(x_k)||^2 must converge to 0.\\n\\n7. Conclusion: For an L-smooth function f, gradient descent with \\eta=1/L converges to a stationary point (a point x* such that \\nabla f(x*) = 0).\"\n}\n```",
